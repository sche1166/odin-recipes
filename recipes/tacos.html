    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <strong>best tacos!</strong> A soft shell taco is layered with refried beans, then wrapped around a hard
        shell taco, which is filled with seasoned ground beef and topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream
        and fresh guacamole. You can top it with whatever you like, but I recommend loading it up! Also, if you don't
        eat meat, put melted cheese on the soft shell, and the refried beans in the hard.</p>

    <ul>
       <li>1 pound ground beef</li> 
       <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix, divided
       <li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>
       <li> â…” cup water</li>
       <li> 12 prepared crisp taco shells</li>
       <li>2 avocados</li>
       <li> 1 tablespoon sour cream</li>
       <li>1 fresh lime, juiced</li>

    </ul>
